<h1>Create a New backchan.nl Conference</h1>

<p>This feature is currently disabled. We're awfully close to turning it on, but we still need to finish off a few more tasks before we open it up. The tool itself works great, but we're still building the management tools.</p>

<p>If you have an upcoming event that you would really like to use backchan.nl for, please feel free to get in touch with <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~dharry/">Drew Harry</a> and we can almost certainly work something out.</p>
